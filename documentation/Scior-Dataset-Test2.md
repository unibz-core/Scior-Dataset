# Test 2 Files

## Description

This document describes the structure of the files generated by the execution of Scior Test 2. For a complete description of Test 2, please access [this link](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior-Tester/blob/main/documentation/Scior-Tester-Test2.md).

Each section below regards a different type of file. The files here generated are equivalent to the ones generated in Test 1, hence here we are going to rely on the descriptions presented in that test's documentation, highlighting only the differences that the generated files may have. The nomenclature's definitions of the files presented here can be accessed in [this link](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior-Dataset#nomenclature-of-files-and-folders).

Test 2 was executed in both complete and incomplete Scior modes (more information about the Scior execution modes are presented in [this link](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior/blob/main/documentation/Scior-Execution-Modes.md)), generating the content presented in two folders inside each one of the catalog's datasets: _tt002_ac_ and _tt002_an_, respectively. These folders contain the same type of documents here described, but with the different content that resulted from the different execution modes.

## Execution Statistics _csv_ Files

The execution statistics _csv_ files generated by Test 2 have the same structure as the ones generated in Test 1 (i.e., all columns available in those files are also available in this test's ones), with the addition of the following column:

- `percentage`: integer that indicates the percentage of the model's classes that were used as input for Test 2

This file is generated according to the pattern `statistics_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY_exZZZ_pcKKK.csv` (e.g., _statistics_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_an_tx001_ex001_pc005.csv_, for the first execution using 5 percent of classes as input of the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).

## Execution Times _csv_ Files

Just like the previous file, the column `percentage` is the only difference between the execution times file generated for Test 1 and Test 2. The new column indicates the percentage of input classes that were used for the test results in that line.

This file is generated according to the pattern `times_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY_exZZZ_pcKKK.csv` (e.g., _times_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_an_tx001_ex001_pc005.csv_, for the first execution using 5 percent of classes as input of the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).

## Inconsistencies _csv_ File

This file reports each execution that leads to an inconsistency in Test 2 in the dataset's taxonomy being evaluated. A single file is created for each taxonomy and the creation only occurs when inconsistencies are found. The _csv_ file contains the following columns:

- `percentage`: integer that indicates the percentage of the model's classes that were used as input for Test 2 when the inconsistency was found
- `execution_number`: is the first column of the _csv_ file. Registers the number of the execution of the test in which the inconsistency was detected

This file is generated according to the pattern `inconsistencies_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY.csv` (e.g., _inconsistencies_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_ac_tx001.csv_, for the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).

The Scior-Tester creates this file only in datasets that Test 2 AC detected inconsistencies during the executions. When Scior detects an inconsistency, it interrupts the current test's execution, and it starts the next one.

## Results _yaml_ Files

There are no structural differences between the results _yaml_ files generated for Test 1 and for Test 2. To access the complete description of the [results _yaml_ files in Test 1, click here.](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior-Dataset/blob/main/documentation/Scior-Dataset-Test1.md#results-yaml-files)

This file is generated according to the pattern `complete_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY_exZZZ_pcKKK.yaml` (e.g., _complete_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_an_tx001_ex001_pc005.yaml_, for the first execution using 5 percent of classes as input of the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).

## Results _csv_ Files

There are no structural differences between the results _csv_ files generated for Test 1 and for Test 2. To access the complete description of the [results _csv_ files in Test 1, click here.](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior-Dataset/blob/main/documentation/Scior-Dataset-Test1.md#results-csv-files)

This file is generated according to the pattern `simple_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY_exZZZ_pcKKK.csv` (e.g., _simple_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_an_tx001_ex001_pc005.csv_, for the first execution using 5 percent of classes as input of the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).

## Knowledge Matrix _csv_ Files

There are no structural differences between the knowledge matrix _csv_ files generated for Test 1 and for Test 2. To access the complete description of the [knowledge matrix _csv_ files in Test 1, click here.](https://github.com/unibz-core/Scior-Dataset/blob/main/documentation/Scior-Dataset-Test1.md#knowledge-matrix-csv-files)

This file is generated according to the pattern `matrix_XXX_tt002_MM_txYYY_exZZZ_pcKKK.csv` (e.g., _matrix_aguiar2018rdbs-o_tt002_an_tx001_ex001_pc005.csv_, for the first execution using 5 percent of classes as input of the taxonomy 001 of the dataset aguiar2018rdbs-o).
